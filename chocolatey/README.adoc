= AsciidoctorJ Chocolatey package.

This directory contains the necessary configuration files for
creating a https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey] package based on a
designated "asciidoctorj-x.y.z-bin.zip" file.

Complete instructions on creating Chocolatey packages can be found at
https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages.

== Quick Instructions

. Set the desired package version in 'asciidoctorj.nuspec' and
  'tools\chocolateyinstall.ps1'.

. Commit your changes.

. Chocolatey doesn't like whitespace in its packaging files. In PowerShell, run the following from the current directory:

----
foreach ($f in @('tools\chocolateyinstall.ps1', 'tools\chocolateyinstall.ps1')) {
  gc $f | ? {$_ -notmatch "^\s*#"} | % {$_ -replace '(^.*?)\s*?[^``]#.*','$1'} | Out-File $f+".~" -en utf8; mv -fo $f+".~" $f
}
----

. Run the following commands:

----
# Create the package
> cd c:\to\this\directory
> choco pack

# Test the package. You'll probably have to run this as administrator.
> choco install .\asciidoctorj.x.y.z.nupkg -dv -s .
> where asciidoctorj
> asciidoctorj --help
> asciidoctorj ...other test commands

# Log into https://chocolatey.org/account and copy your API key.
# (This assumes you don't have a key set in your Chocolatey config.)
# Push the package to chocolatey.org.
> choco push --api-key=your-api-key asciidoctorj.x.y.z.nupkg
----

. Add back whitespace:

----
git checkout -- tools
----
