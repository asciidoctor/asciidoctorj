The safe modes in order from most insecure to most secure are:

`UNSAFE`::
A safe mode level that disables any security features enforced by Asciidoctor.
+
*This is the default safe mode for the CLI.*

`SAFE`::
This safe mode level prevents access to files which reside outside of the parent directory of the source file.
It disables all macros, except the include directive.
The paths to include files must be within the parent directory.
It allows assets to be embedded in the document.

`SERVER`::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from setting attributes that would affect the rendering of the document.
This level trims the attribute `docfile` to its relative path and prevents the document from:
+
--
* setting +source-highlighter+, +doctype+, +docinfo+ and +backend+
* seeing +docdir+

It allows +icons+ and +linkcss+.
--

`SECURE`::
A safe mode level that disallows the document from attempting to read files from the file system and including their contents into the document.
Additionally, it:
+
--
* disables icons
* disables the `include` directive
* data can not be retrieved from URIs
* prevents access to stylesheets and JavaScripts
* sets the backend to `html5`
* disables `docinfo` files
* disables `data-uri`
* disables `docdir` and `docfile`
* disables source highlighting

Asciidoctor extensions may still embed content into the document depending on whether they honor the safe mode setting.

*This is the default safe mode for the API.*
